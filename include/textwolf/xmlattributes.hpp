---------------------------------------------------------------------
    The template library textwolf implements an input iterator on
    a set of XML path expressions without backward references on an
    STL conforming input iterator as source. It does no buffering
    or read ahead and is dedicated for stream processing of XML
    for a small set of XML queries.
    Stream processing in this context refers to processing the
    document without buffering anything but the current result token
    processed with its tag hierarchy information.
